# Berd

Berd is an open-source desktop app for working with AI agents. It is built with
Tauri 2 and React 19 and talks to the upstream Goose backend through the ACP
WebSocket served by a `goose serve` sidecar.

The repository builds a general-purpose public distribution. Organizations can
also create enterprise distributions by supplying managed provider settings,
private resources, and release infrastructure through the repository's
distribution seams without adding private material to the public source tree.

## Getting started

```bash
just setup
just dev
```

`just setup` installs pnpm dependencies, builds the vendored `@aaif/goose-sdk`,
and prepares the Goose backend pinned by `goose-backend.lock.json` in your
platform cache directory. `just dev` reuses that stamped pinned binary and fails
if the lockfile commit no longer matches the cached build.

If you already have an upstream Goose binary you want to test, set
`GOOSE_BIN=/path/to/goose` before running `just dev`; that is an explicit local
override and bypasses the managed pinned checkout.

To bump the default Goose backend, update the lockfile in a PR:

```bash
scripts/update-goose-backend-lock.sh main # or a tag/branch/sha
just goose-sync                          # fetch/build the new pinned commit
```

## Bundling and distributions

Tauri bundles the Goose backend as an external sidecar. By default, `just bundle`
stages the pinned managed Goose binary from `goose-backend.lock.json` and then
runs `pnpm tauri build`:

```bash
just bundle
```

You can stage an explicit local binary with
`GOOSE_BIN=/path/to/goose just stage-sidecar`. Staging creates
`src-tauri/binaries/goosed-<rust-host-triple>`, matching the
`"externalBin": ["binaries/goosed"]` entry in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.

The public build is self-contained and does not require private package
registries or enterprise credentials. Enterprise distributors may overlay
private agents, runtime configuration, optional companion tools, update
channels, and signing or publishing infrastructure in their own private build
orchestration.

## Optional companion CLI

Berd includes a distribution seam for bundling an optional companion CLI as an
app resource. The public app does not require a private CLI package; enterprise
distributors can provide and package their own implementation while retaining
the normal Berd build and validation flow.

## Adding an experiment

Experiments are user-local preferences for unstable UI or workflow behavior.
Untouched experiments follow the global auto-enable setting, which defaults on
in dev builds and off in production builds. Use
`.agents/skills/experimental-features/SKILL.md` for the current workflow,
registry contract, storage rules, Tauri guardrails, and test coverage.
