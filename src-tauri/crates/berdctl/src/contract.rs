//! The embedded contract artifacts, parsed once at startup:
//!
//! - `api-surface.json` — the client-neutral wire surface of the app's
//!   control API (groups → actions → description + fields + JSON Schema,
//!   plus the wire `protocolVersion`). Any client of `POST /v1/call` can
//!   consume it; this CLI consumes the flat field model.
//! - `cli-surface.json` — the CLI projection: the noun/verb tree mapping
//!   onto groups/actions and the CLI-only prose (noun abouts, verb
//!   summaries, after-help footers).
//!
//! Both are generated from the renderer's command modules
//! (`pnpm generate:berdctl-contract`); zod schemas and the command-module
//! prose stay the single authored source. Cross-artifact consistency is
//! checked by [`crate::validate::contract_errors`] and enforced by this
//! crate's tests — the artifacts are embedded at compile time, so a binary
//! whose tests pass cannot disagree with them at runtime.
